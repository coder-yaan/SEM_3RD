The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
